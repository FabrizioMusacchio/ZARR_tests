# ZARR test scripts

I used the scripts in this repository to create the following blog posts about the _Zarr_ file format:

* [Zarr â€“ or: How to save NumPy arrays](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2022-10-19-Zarr_for_NumPy_arrays)
* [Using Zarr for image files -- The OME-ZARR standard](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2022-10-24-Zarr_and_images)
